        <p>I'm Phillip Davis</p>
        <p>Welcome to my first coded website.
           Iâ€™m learning to code so that I'm able to empower my brand, my clients, 
           and my legacy. Back in the late 90s, early 2000s, I had an interest 
           in learnig to code. I first got introduced to it when I was enrolled 
           at Horry Georgetown Technical College, studying computer technology. 
           I messed around and dropped out because I was afraid of the challenge. 
           Around 2003, I bought a book called HTML for Dummies. I cracked that 
           book maybe twice and put it down, again, afraid of the chanllenge and 
           this time, also because I had done gotten myself involved with too many 
           other things. I couldn't slow down enough to absorb anything technical. 
           I'll tell you, I've had the roughest, most discombobulated journey up to 
           the point where I am now. I feel like I have lost out and missed so many 
           opportunites, but at the same time, I have made some progress. I'm not 
           complete though, and that has me hard on myself. Sucks sometimes, 
           but I'm a work in progress.</p>
